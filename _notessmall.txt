Back up \/

Make a program that copies Documents to iCloud Hold.txt. Idk.


Other \/
binarySearch5.d -> opCmp
batchcompile.d -> "rdmd batchcompile barry ariki", then "rdmd batchcompile -run barry ariki"
idiomatic.d -> compare with more C like

jpreview.d - to go through each source file. "./cf jpreview" - to compile.

usbdotclean.d - do dot_clean on the folders and sub folders ('./usbdotclean', or './usbdotclean -all') '-all' does the whole USB drive otherwise it just does jpro/dpro2
numral.d - truthers code program - though, incomplete (eg. billgates 33)
threewaypool.d - at Adam's

>>
Compile run \/

module cfr;

import std.stdio : writeln;
import std.process : wait, spawnProcess;
import std.string : join;

void main() {
    immutable commands = [["clear"],
        ["dub", "build"],
        ["./guesspop", "Testing"]];
    foreach(i, command; commands) {
        writeln("D> ", command.join(" "));
        wait(spawnProcess(command));
        if (i == 0)
            writeln("D> ", command.join(" "), " (screen cleared)");
    }
}

Or just put 'dub -- Testing' ???
<<

Work out \/
forward.d - Forward functions

linq.d - tuples (3 numbers)


iCloud \/
savetoicloud.d


Working on \/
clearnum.d (1,000 instead of just 1000, but it's not right for most negative numbers)
Calendar.d
smartcopy.d - for backing up 256 flash drive //Errors on .Spotlight in 256 flash drive
*xmltest.d

miniwebserver.d - 12.3.2019 access denied.
backups.d - 4.10.2019

import core.thread;
Thread.sleep(15.dur!"msecs");
invoke.d

Latest:
invoke.d - run another program displaying the output in it
Namedpara.d

updateiusb.d - copy Hold.txt to iUSB and Jyble
wordcount.d - rdmd wordcount -run one two three

See: clearnum.d, also Juration, and jmisc
<<

See char2num2.d

ddlinkjava.d - double link list

cirsinglylinkedlist.d - uses 'static foreach' (started: 18 2 2018)

import std.process;
// Run DMD on the file "myprog.d", specifying a few compiler switches:
auto dmdPid = spawnProcess(["dmd", "-O", "-release", "-inline", "myprog.d" ]);
if (wait(dmdPid) != 0)
    writeln("Compilation failed!");

seb.d - editing a CVS file, had a web link

Jraining \/

sums.d - './cf sums' (compiles with JMisc)
tables.d - times table program, also in Google+. Uses a delegate
takeaways.d - maths program (bit crazy with negative numbers)

02102409119

jstopwatch.d - there's been a change

jrange.d - (good one to work out 22 11 2017)

textscroll.d - (eg. ./textscroll topsecret.txt)

batchcompile.d - compile more than one file at a time; run one program after another.

timedur.d -> mucking with dates

import std.format, std.stdio; auto s = format!"%s is %s"("Pi", 3.14); - see formatI.d

taketwo.d - for the scrabble pieces game.

fleas.d - my dog has fleas, D version of Alan's program.

Bop! \/
tp.d:
Undefined symbols for architecture x86_64:
  "_getch", referenced from:
      _D2tp5pagerFS3std5stdio4FileiaZv in tp.o
ld: symbol(s) not found for architecture x86_64
clang: error: linker command failed with exit code 1 (use -v to see invocation)
Error: linker exited with status 1

autom.d \/ use on ideone.com `dmd autom` `./autom < autom.txt`

std.functional -> pipe (look into it!)
round.d - trying to work out how this program works! dmd -run round < round.txt

//import std.stdio: File, byLine, writeln; //#byLine not found .. actually `File` covers it.

reorder.d -> for SchedJoel. It edits the ini file. e.g. `./reorder alarms.ini alarm` for SchedJoel or `./reorder questions question` for Know It All.

lineSearch.d -> prints all the lines (including paragraphs) that have the search predicate e.g. ./lineSearch money.ini cost (10 3 2017 - made at Putaruru Church Joyful Noise, while the singing)

See structs.d for crazy error!

libcalc.d -> would be great if could have thing working! e.g. writeln(calc(“1 + 2”));

auto getSeconds(in long time) {
	import std.conv : text;
	return text(time / 1000, ".", time % 1000);
}

DCookbook source files are here and test ones (of my own) too eg. tree.d

spellscan.d -> for words marked '(sp)'. Open Finder -> Documents -> Hold.txt. Copy Hold to here (/Users/joelchristensen/jpro/dpro2/small) - see spelling.txt

term.d - alt terminal. Left and right cursor keys work.

FreeBook bookmark: strings - Double quotes, not single quotes

match.d - game, not working

D phobos bug? No, use dchar.
static if (is(T == char)) {
	import std.stdio;
	import std.algorithm: sort;
	import std.conv: to;

	string name = "bcda";
	writeln(name.to!(dchar[]).sort!"a < b");
}


batchcompile.d: Going through source and executable files.

Try './jpreview'

Program information:

increase.d - for having hours minutes seconds that the hour can go beyond 23.

towide.d - is for coverting tabs to ".   " (not counting the quotes), maybe back again too.

jecatext.d - start of text editing program

swap.d - one swap doesn't even work.
switch.d - has Hamish is awesome.
char2num.d - has correlations with certain words and names to numbers, adding them up and showing the totals.
char2num2.d - use ./cf to compile ('./cf char2num2')

Source files to work on \/
algorithmfromwindy.d

tostring.d

lambda.d

dalleg5.d - use: 'dmd dalleg5 -debug=TDD' to see more stuff.

testsuite folder is off: http://erdani.com/index.php?cID=109 - I don't think much of it though.

cafe.d - was programmed in a cafe in Hamilton, New Zealand.

11.11.2010
Spent for ever to find out that with the ini.d file I had to have the '=' right beside the name and value.

9.09.2010
dotfoo.d - not work (a.foo(b);) - not exist now

22.08.2010
Put in dmdscript including in folder small: dstest.d scripttest.d (or some thing). Haven't gotten any where with them. I think they're ported to D2.0

26.06.'10
enforce is not found with 401 end - 402 example - think mistake 'std.exception' not 'std.contracts'
Added std.contracts for enforce and go this:
	C:\Jpro\dpro2\small>dmd exchmessbetThreads.d
	exchmessbetThreads.d(17): Error: no [] operator overload for type Tuple!(Tid,int
	)
	exchmessbetThreads.d(18): Error: no [] operator overload for type Tuple!(Tid,int
	)
filecopyingwithatwist.d - doesn't work (and I copied it from the book 406 - 407)!?
	:\>dmd filecopyingwithatwist.d

std.string.find is deprecated - What is going on!? Make you own one instead? It's different than the book. What is used instead? [./] - indexOf instead. I think find would be found in another module. .. didn't have the find trouble last time I used it alright.

Got this fluke in the mput.d program (maths):
Enter 'quit' to exit
65+80=145
You're right!
52+93=145
You're right!

Notable:
insertion_sort.d
line_closure.d
